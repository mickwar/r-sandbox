\section{Tests on Historical Means}

For the olives in regions two and four we want to test whether the means of the acid measurements differ significantly from their historical averages. We test 
\begin{eqnarray*}
H_{02}:\m{\mu}_{02}=(1300,120,265,7310,820,45,65,28)^\top \\
H_{04}:\m{\mu}_{04}=(1230,105,275,7360,830,41,75,38)^\top
\end{eqnarray*}
where $H_{02}$ and $H_{04}$ are the null hypotheses for tests and regions two and four, respectively.

We will use Hotelling's $T^2$ test statistic (a multivariate analogue of the univariate $t$ test statistic) defined as
\[ T^2 = n(\overline{\m{x}}-\m{\mu}_0)^\top\m{S}^{-1}(\overline{\m{x}}-\m{\mu}_0) \]
to test for significant departures from the hypothesized mean $\m{\mu}_0$. Large differences in the mean of any variable from the historical mean will result in a large $T^2$ statistic. We can convert $T^2$ into an $F$ distribution via
\[ \frac{\nu -p+1}{\nu p}T^2 = F \sim F_{p,\nu-p+1}. \]
where $\nu=n-1$ degrees of freedom and $p=8$ acids.

Table \ref{history} shows the test statistics and $p$-values for each region's null hypothesis. We fail to reject both hypotheses. There is not enough evidence for each region to suggest that the means of each acid differ significantly from their historical means.
