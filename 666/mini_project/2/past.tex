\section{Tests on Historical Means}

For the olives in regions two and four we want to test whether the means of the acid measurements differ significantly from their historical averages. We test 
\begin{eqnarray*}
H_{02}:\m{\mu}_{02}=(1300,120,265,7310,820,45,65,28)^\top \\
H_{04}:\m{\mu}_{04}=(1230,105,275,7360,830,41,75,38)^\top
\end{eqnarray*}
\noindent where $H_{02}$ and $H_{04}$ are the null hypotheses for tests and regions two and four, respectively.
