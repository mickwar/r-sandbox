#V1 is date
#V2 is number of at-bats in the game (n)
#V3 is number of homeruns in the game (y)

# Choosing the priors.  From the previous year (2000), Bonds had 49 homeruns
# with 480 at-bats.  His percentage of homeruns that year is 11%.  However, this
# percentage has been increasing since he began his professional career in 1986.
# So we will want to choose priors that produce a mean of about 10%.  Since
# Bonds appears to have been improving during his career, we need the variance
# to be high enough to take into account this change of homerun rates.

# only takes into account when bonds was with the giants 1993 - 2000, medium weights
a2=4
b2=45

# only data from 2000 season used, stronger weights
