\section{Model}

We follow the formulation of \cite{higdon:2008}. At input settings $\m{x}_i,\ldots,\m{x}_n$, our oberservations of the chemical process $\m{y}_i,\ldots,\m{y}_n$ are modeled by
\begin{eqnarray}
\m{y}_i = \m{\zeta}(\m{x}_i) + \m{\epsilon}_i
\end{eqnarray}
where $\m{\zeta}(\m{x}_i)$ denotes the true and $\m{\epsilon}_i$ is observation error. The response is $n_\eta$-variate with each variable being a relative abundance of an anion from the VENDAMS procedure. There is $p_x=1$ variable controllable by the experimenter: initial electron concentration.
\begin{eqnarray}
\m{y}_i = \m{\zeta}(\m{x}_i)  + \m{\epsilon}_i = \m{\eta}(\m{x}, \m{\theta}) + \m{\delta}(\m{x}_i) + \m{\epsilon}_i
\end{eqnarray}
