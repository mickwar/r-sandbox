\section{Model}

We follow the formulation of \cite{kennedy:2001}. At input settings $\m{x}_i,\ldots,\m{x}_n$, our oberservations of the chemical process $\m{y}_i,\ldots,\m{y}_n$ are modeled by
\begin{eqnarray}
\m{y}_i = \zeta(\m{x}_i) + \epsilon_i
\end{eqnarray}
where $\zeta(\m{x}_i)$ denotes the true and $\epsilon_i$ is observation error. The response $\m{y}_i$ is $q$-variate with each variable being a relative abundance of an anion from the VENDAMS procedure. The length $p_x=1$ variable $\m{x}_i$ controllable by the experimenter is initial electron concentration.

We are primarily interested in calibrating the computer simulator so that future experiments may have more reliable output from the simulator. This would prevent the need to obtain more field observations in order to gain understanding of the chemical process. As such, we decompose the true process $\zeta(\m{x}_i)$ into two components, simulator and discrepancy terms:
\begin{eqnarray}
\m{y}_i = \eta(\m{x}_i, \m{\theta}) + \delta(\m{x}_i) + \epsilon_i.
\end{eqnarray}
The stochastic term $\eta(\m{x}_i, \m{\theta})$ is a Gaussian process emulator for the computer simulator at calibrated inputs $\m{\theta}$, and $\delta(\m{x}_i)$ accounts for differences between the simulator and reality (i.e. $\delta(\m{x}_i) = \zeta(\m{x}_i) - \eta(\m{x}_i, \m{\theta})$). The $p_t$-vector of calibrated inputs $\m{\theta}$ correspond to the (physically) uncontrollable computer simulator inputs at their best setting. These inputs are the chemical reaction rates, fixed quantities that are either very hard or impossible to obtain analytically.

The responses are centered and scaled so the emulator $\eta(\cdot, \cdot)$ and discrepancy $\delta(\cdot)$ terms follow a zero-mean Gaussian process with product covariance having exponential form
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathrm{Cov}((\m{x},\m{t}),(\m{x}',\m{t}')) = \frac{1}{\lambda}\prod_{k=1}^{p_x}\rho_k^{4(x_k-x_k')^2}\times\prod_{k=1}^{p_t}\rho_{p_x+k}^{4(t_k-t_k')^2}
\end{eqnarray}

Further details on the model and necessary data transformations can be found in \cite{higdon:2008}.
