\section{Introduction}

Variable electron and neutral density attachment mass spectrometry (VENDAMS) is a new approach for measuring chemical reaction rate constants. Such reactions may be very complex and product abundances can be modeled using a set of many differential equations; a computer simulator has been developed to simultaneously solve the equations when given the reaction rates (the data are shown in Figure \ref{data}). 

We model the computer simulator with a Gaussian process to allow us to obtain posterior estimates on the chemical reaction rates. We also determine the sensitivity of simulator inputs as it relates to the variability in the output. By comparing the simulator with field trials we calculate a discrepancy function (also a Gaussian process) to assess simulator bias at certain input locations.
