\section{Introduction}

Measuring physical processes are often very expensive to obtain. Computer simulators are subsequently built to provide supplemental data to the physical process. This project analyzes anion relative abundances of mass spectrometry experiments measured at various initial electron concentrations. A simulator which emulates the chemical reactions within the mass spectrometer takes reaction rates as inputs.

We use a large number of simulation runs to calibrate something something. Go go go go here. Here's the model next.
