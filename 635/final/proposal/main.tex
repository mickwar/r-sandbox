\noindent Stat 635 Final Proposal
\bigskip

\noindent I'm going to do a review on a paper entitle \emph{Maximizing generalized linear mixed model likelihoods with an automated Monte Carlo EM algorithm} by James G. Booth and James P. Hobert in 1999. They discuss issues surrounding certain methods of maximizing likelihoods of linear mixed models. A concern the authors have is that approaches for maximizing likelihoods vary in their estimates and the variance of the estimates. The authors propose two Monte Carlo EM algorithms to obtain exact maximum likelihood estimates.
\bigskip

\noindent I wish to review this paper and recreate their analyses on their data. I hope to have working examples for their method and have the code available for future use.
